# By The Moonlight

By the Moonlight is a browser game, deployed [here](https://raeelwell.github.io/Rae-Ada-Capstone/).

This is my Capstone project for [Ada Developer's Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/).

The project was concepted and built independently using Javascript and React framework, sourced from the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) file.

## Gameplay

As a novice mage who dreams of being a master wizard, the player starts with nothing. In order to facilitate their dream, they sneak off into the woods at night where they kill monsters for gold.

The mage then uses this gold to purchase spells from the Market, so that they can defeat more powerful monsters and purchase more powerful spells.

Upon buying the most expensive spell in the game, Essence of Victory, the player wins and their day count is displayed to them. The goal of this game is to have the lowest total day count possible.

## Features

By The Moonlight features a customizable character with 48 portraits sourced from [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/).

The turn-based combat system has a series of checks which calculate player damage, status effects, and monster damage in sequence. Each turn is summarized by a combat log, with outcomes reflected in both player and monster stat bars.

Monsters are randomly generated with a scaling formula based off of the total cost of spells in the player inventory and the total number of days in the game. This allows the difficulty of the game to scale incrementally with player progress until a player is either victorious... or killed by a monster.

The game also has 10 available spells to use in combat, each which feature unique functionality, such as:
* damage over a series of turns
* invulnerability (with a catch!)
* doubling your gold gains 
* self healing

Experiment with different combinations of spells to see what works best!

## About This Project

By The Moonlight was my first large-scale solo coding project. When I began this three-week project, I challenged myself to learn how to use React and code in Javascript, and I think I have accomplished that goal. 

While I'm sure that my self-teaching has left me with many areas that I can improve on, I am proud to have delivered a finished, working product by the deadline.

If you have any questions or comments about By The Moonlight, I would love to hear them - you can contact me [@Raelet](https://twitter.com/Raelet) on twitter or email me at rae.elwell@gmail.com.
